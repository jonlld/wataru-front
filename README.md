# Wataru (Frontend)

## Project Outline

Solo polyglot project for Code Chrysalis Immersive. A simple full-stack app built using a new language, which allows users to translate phrases from any language into Japanese and store them in a boutique travel phrasebook.

Tech-stack:

Frontend:
Javascript, React, React-Bootstrap, Vanilla CSS

Backend:
Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, PostgreSQL, Google Translate API

## Repos

The project uses separate repos for the frontend and backend. The project depends on Google Translate API and as such a key is required to run the app - this should be added to a 'credentials.json' file in the root folder of the 'wataru' (backend) repo.
